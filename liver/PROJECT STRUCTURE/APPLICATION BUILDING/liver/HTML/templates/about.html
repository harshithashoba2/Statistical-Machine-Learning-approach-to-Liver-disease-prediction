          The liver is an organ about the size of a football. It sits just under
          your rib cage on the right side of your abdomen. The liver is
          essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic
          substances. Liver disease can be inherited (genetic). Liver problems
          can also be caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such
          as viruses, alcohol use and obesity. Over time, conditions that damage
          the liver can lead to scarring (cirrhosis), which can lead to liver
          failure, a life-threatening condition. But early treatment may give
          the liver time to heal.

            Your liver is your body’s second-largest organ (after the skin). It
            sits just under your ribcage on the right side and is about the size
            of a football. The liver separates nutrients and waste as they move
            through your digestive system. It also produces bile, a substance
            that carries toxins out of your body and aids in digestion. The term
            “liver disease” refers to any of several conditions that can affect
            and damage your liver. Over time, liver disease can cause cirrhosis
            (scarring). As more scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, the
            liver can no longer function properly. Left untreated, liver disease
            can lead to liver failure and liver cancer.

            Overall, about 1 in 10 Americans (30 million in total) have some
            type of liver disease. About 5.5 million people in the U.S. have
            chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Some types of liver disease are
            becoming more common in the U.S. because they are related to rising
            rates of obesity. An estimated 20% to 30% of adults have excess fat
            in their liver, a condition called non-alcohol rekated fatty liver
            disease (NAFD). This may be renamed metabolic-associated fatty liver
            disease (MAFLD) to reflect its relationship to metabolic syndrome
            and conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol
            and obesity.
